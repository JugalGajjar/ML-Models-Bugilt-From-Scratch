# ML Models Built From Scratch
This repository contains implementations of various machine learning models, built from the ground up using Python. The primary goal is to provide a hands-on learning experience and a deeper understanding of the underlying algorithms.

### Models Included:
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Naive Bayes Classifier

### How to Use:
1. Clone the Repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JugalGajjar/ML-Models-Built-From-Scratch.git
   ```
2. Install Dependencies.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Explore the Code.
4. Run the Models.
